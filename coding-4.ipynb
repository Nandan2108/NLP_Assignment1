      "The hardest part of tokenization in English was handling contractions and punctuation correctly. Words like don’t and it’s need to be split into meaningful components, which is not handled well by naïve tokenization. Compared to English, tokenization in morphologically rich languages can be more complex due to suffixes and inflections. Punctuation also increases difficulty because it is often attached to words but carries its own meaning. Multiword expressions such as place names and technical terms add another layer of complexity because they represent single concepts. Overall, punctuation, morphology, and MWEs make tokenization more challenging but also more linguistically accurate.\n"
